This shell implements the following:

-history
-exit command
-limited external commands(ls,cat,clear,wc seem to work)
-pipelining for external commands

The pipelining can be tested with ls|wc -w|..|wc -w or something similar, as not all commands are implemented.

Additionally, it has 3 internally implemented commands:
-cpp
-tee
-dirname

Managed to compile it with g++ -o output shell.cpp
